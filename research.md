## Tumor microenvironment
We study cellular interactions and molecular signals in the tumor microenvironment that shape tumor progression and therapy response.

## Extracellular vesicles
We investigate extracellular vesicles as key mediators of intercellular communication in cancer and immune regulation.

## Cancer immunology
We explore mechanisms of immune activation and suppression in cancer, with the goal of improving anti-tumor immunity.

## Mitochondria fitness
We examine how mitochondrial fitness and metabolic adaptation influence cellular states and immune function in disease contexts.
